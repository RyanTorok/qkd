To run this code through the terminal/command prompt:

1) Navigate into the qkd package (This is the folder which contains your .java files)
2) Enter "javac *.java" (without the quotes)
3) You should see any compilation error messages show up. If you see nothing, this means your code compiled. A .class file should have been generated for every .java file in your qkd package.
4) Navate into the directory which contains the qkd package. 

For example, if you have CS_309 > Project_1 > qkd > [all your .java and .class files]
You want to navigate to the Project_1 folder. If you run "ls", you should see qkd printed out.

To run the testing script, run "java qkd.QubitTester" (again, no quotes)

The output should be displayed in the console. 

ALTERNATIVELY: You can use an IDE. Eclipse and Intellij are the most popular. I recommend using Intellij for no reason other than I use Intellij and I will be better suited to help you resolve IDE issues. 

Let us know if you find any problems with this protocol.
